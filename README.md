Three categories of files :
 - cantor_sets_generation, essentially combinatorics to compute all possible coefficients in a Gauss-Cantor set up to a certain degree of precision
 - continued_fractions_toolbox, to compute the value of a finite continued fraction, compare two continued fractions, etc...
 - thickness_computation, the algorithm to compute thickness and some theoretical predictions in the case of simple Gauss-Cantor sets
